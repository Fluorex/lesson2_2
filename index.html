        <h1 align="center">Hello, my name is Dmytro</h1>
        <h3 align="center">I'm from Kharkiv and I want to show you my city.</h3>
        <span>Kharkiv is located in the north-eastern part of Ukraine in close proximity to the border with Russia (about 35 km), on the border of two landscape zones - forest-steppe and steppe. The climate in the city is temperate continental; winters are cold and snowy, summers are hot. The average temperature in January is minus 4.6 degrees Celsius, in July - plus 21.3 degrees Celsius. The City Day of Kharkiv is celebrated on August 23.

The emblem of Kharkiv is similar to its historical coat of arms adopted at the end of the 18th century. It depicts a crossed cornucopia (filled with fruits and crowned with flowers) and a caduceus (a golden rod with silver wings) entwined with snakes. The cornucopia symbolizes natural wealth. Caduceus is an invariable attribute of the god Mercury, who in antiquity was considered the patron of merchants and travelers. The snakes symbolize wisdom.

This city is one of the largest industrial centers of Ukraine with enterprises of high-tech industries: power engineering, electrical industry, transport and agricultural engineering, instrument making, radio electronics, and the aerospace industry. Kharkiv also plays an important role in the military industry of the country.

Kharkiv is one of the largest transport hubs in Ukraine. A number of European transport corridors pass through this city. The international airport of Kharkiv, one of the largest in Eastern Ukraine, is located 12 km south of the city center. It offers regular flights to such cities as Berlin, Budapest, Dortmund, Kyiv, Prague, Vienna, Barcelona, Istanbul, Milan, Tallinn, Vilnius, Krakow, Lviv, Rome, Tel Aviv, Warsaw, and a number of others.

Public transport is represented by mini-buses, buses, trolleybuses, trams. The Kharkiv Metro has 3 lines with a total length of about 40 km. There are communities of all major world religions in Kharkiv. Most of the believing residents of the city profess Orthodox Christianity.

In terms of the level of education and science, Kharkiv universities and scientific institutions are among the best in Ukraine (and in some cases in Eastern Europe), often competing with those in Kyiv. The most famous education institution of the city is V. Karazin Kharkiv National University. After the Ivan Franko National University of Lviv, it is the oldest university in Ukraine.</span>

        <span>During World War II, Kharkiv was the focus of major battles. The city was captured by Nazi Germany on 24 October 1941. A disastrous Red Army offensive failed to recover the city in May 1942. It was retaken (Operation Star) on 16 February 1943, but lost again to the Germans on 15 March 1943. 23 August 1943 saw a final liberation.


A memorial to 23 August 1943, the end of German occupation during World War II
On the eve of the occupation, Kharkiv's prewar population of 700,000 had been doubled by the influx of refugees. What remained of the pre-war Jewish population of 130,000, were slated by the Germans for "special treatment": between December 1941 and January 1942, they killed and buried an estimated 15,000 Jews in a ravine outside of town named Drobytsky Yar. Over their 22 months occupation they executed a further 30,000 residents, among them suspected Soviet partisans and, after a brief period of toleration, Ukrainian nationalists. 80,000 people died of hunger, cold and disease. 60,000 were forcibly transported to Germany as slave workers (Ostarbeiter). (Among these was Boris Romanchenko. The 96-year old survivor of forced labor at the Buchenwald, Peenemünde, Dora and Bergen Belsen concentration camps was killed when Russian fire hit his apartment bloc on 18 March 2022).

By the time of Kharkiv's liberation in August 1943, the surviving population had been reduced to under 200,000. Seventy percent of the city had been destroyed.</span>
